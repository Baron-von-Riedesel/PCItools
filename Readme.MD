 A few tools to display the current PCI status

 - PCIInfo: display current status of all PCI devices
 - IDE1:    display status of mass storage controllers
 - USB1:    display status of USB controllers
 - VGA1:    display status of display controllers


 2. How to create the Binaries

  All programs are assembled using JWasm ( Masm should do as well ). A few
 programs are protected-mode applications and will need additional tools
 found in the HX development package. The .BAT files supplied will create
 the binaries.
